# Cuboids

## Challenge

This API manages bags and cuboids. A cuboid is a three-dimensional rectangular box. Each face of a cuboid is a 
rectangle and adjacent faces meet at right angles. A cube is a cuboid with equal dimensions. A cuboid has a 
volume that is straightforward to calculate.

A bag is a malleable container with adjustable dimensions, but a fixed volume. The bag can expand to hold any 
shape or combination of shapes, but the volume of the bag is limited and cannot expand. In our model a bag 
has many cuboids. 

This app has an almost complete test suite.

The tests to update and delete a cuboid are incomplete, your task is to improve them.

The other tests are valid and you must not modify them. In other words, you need to add the missing functionalities so that these tests pass.

You should also take note of the linter and prettier. The linter is currently passing and must pass on completion
of the challenge, without any modifications to the config. 

**Note**: The only tests to be modified are tests to update and delete a cuboid. All other tests must remain unchanged.
